    <h>Quaker Game</h>
    <p> Friends in the Quaker tradition base our worship entirely on expectant waiting. We meet in plain, unadorned rooms. There are no pulpits, and our benches face each other. We have no prearranged prayers, readings, sermons, hymns, or musical orchestrations. During worship, a message may come to us, from God or inner discovery. Friends have found that messages may be for our personal reflection or for sharing on another occasion. Or they may be a leading to stand and speak. Following a spoken message, we return to the silence to examine ourselves in the Light of that message. Meeting for worship ends when one Friend, designated in advance, shakes hands with his or her neighbors. Then everyone shakes hands. </p>
