    <h>Silent Meeting</h>
    <p> Friends in the Quaker tradition base our worship entirely on expectant waiting. We meet in plain, unadorned rooms. There are no pulpits, and our benches face each other. During worship, a message may come to us, from God or inner discovery. Friends have found that messages may be for our personal reflection or for sharing on another occasion. Or they may be a leading to stand and speak.  </p>
